          The first thing he knew was that he was lying on his back, and that
          the roof of the cave was directly over his head. He was lying on a
          pile of something soft and springy, and he could feel the warm breath
          of the fire on his face. He tried to move, but his limbs were stiff
          and heavy, and he could not even open his eyes. He tried to speak, but
          his throat was dry and his tongue felt thick and heavy. He tried to
          think, but his mind was blank. He could not remember anything. He
          could not remember his name, or where he was, or what he was doing. He
          could not remember anything at all.
